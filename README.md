## Installation
Libraries used: `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `wordcloud`

Apart from `wordcloud`, all other libraries should come with the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

`wordcloud` can be installed with conda (further details [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/wordcloud))

## Project Motivation
I created this project as part of an assignment for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanadegree Program. 

I will be analysing Boston Airbnb data for this project to answer the following three questions:
1. What the top-rated neighbourhoods neighbourhoods in Boston in terms of location? Do properties in these neighbourhoods tend to be more expensive?
2. What are the characteristics of each neighbourhood through the hosts' eyes?
3. What are the key predictors of a property's listing price?

## File Descriptions
Each Jupyter notebook contains code that analyses the dataset to answer one of the questions above. Here are the Jupyter notebooks that correspond to questions 1-3 above.
1. TopRatedLocations.ipynb
2. NeighbourhoodFeatures.ipynb
3. ListingPriceModel.ipynb

listings.csv contains the raw data that was analysed, downloaded from Kaggle.

## Results
The results of this analysis are laid out in this post here (link to be added when ready).

  ## Licensing and Acknowledgements
